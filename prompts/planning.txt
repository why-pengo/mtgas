I would like to save my Magic the Gathering: Arena games statistics in a database. I want to track the following
information for each game:
- Date and time of the game
- Opponent's name
- Result (win/loss)
- Deck used
- Duration of the game
- Format (Standard, Modern, etc.)
- All plays during the game, with details such as cards played, mana spent.
To achieve this, design a database schema that can accommodate all of this information.
It will likely need to create multiple tables to store the different types of data, such as a table for games,
a table for decks, and a table for plays.
To collect the data, find a way to extract the relevant information from the game logs.
There is a recent log file in data/Player.log that contains the details of a game.
Parse this log file and analyze to see if the necessary information can be extracted.
Once the data in the log file is parsed and understood, plan the database schema and the process
for inserting the data into the database.
Consider using a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL, and design the tables with appropriate relationships
to ensure data integrity and efficient querying.
Then implement the database and write the necessary code to parse the log file and insert the data into the database.
Test the entire process to ensure that the data is being correctly extracted, stored, and can be queried effectively.
Then design a user interface or reporting system to visualize the statistics and insights from the stored game data,
such as win rates, most used decks, and performance against decks and color types.
Use Django to create a web application that allows users to view their game statistics and insights in an interactive way.
Use d3.js to create visualizations for the statistics, such as bar charts for win rates and pie charts for deck usage.
Write pytests to ensure that the data parsing, database insertion, and querying processes are working correctly.
Download JSON data from Scryfall instead of using the API to get card details, and store this data in the database to enrich the game statistics with card information.
Make sure to handle any edge cases, such as incomplete log files or missing data, and implement error handling to ensure the application is robust and can handle unexpected situations gracefully.
Use the black, flake8 and isort tools to ensure that the code is well-formatted and adheres to best practices for readability and maintainability.
Create a makefile to automate the setup of the database, running the application, and running tests to streamline the development process and ensure consistency across different environments.
Finally, document the entire process, including the database schema design, data parsing logic, and how to set up and run the application, so that others can understand and contribute to the project in the
future.
Use pyproject.toml instead of a requirements.txt
